# AI Prompt Design - Xorstack Health Model

## Overview

This document details the prompt engineering strategy for all AI-powered features in Xorstack Health Model. All prompts are designed for clinical accuracy, safety, and consistency.

## Design Principles

1. **Clinical Accuracy**: Use medically appropriate terminology and structure
2. **Safety First**: Include guardrails against unsafe or inappropriate responses
3. **Context-Aware**: Leverage session context for better outputs
4. **Structured Output**: Enforce JSON schemas where applicable
5. **Language Consistency**: Match output language to user preferences
6. **PHI Protection**: Never echo identifiable patient information

## Prompt Templates

### 1. Clinical Note Generation

- Use appropriate medical terminology
- Maintain clinical accuracy and clarity
- Organize information logically
- [Detail level instruction: low/medium/high]
- Output language: [language]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "soap": {
    "subjective": "Chief complaint, HPI, ROS, relevant history",
    "objective": "Vital signs, physical exam findings, test results",
    "assessment": "Diagnoses, clinical impressions",
    "plan": "Treatment plan, medications, follow-up, patient education"
  },
  "plaintext": "Full formatted clinical note as readable text"
}
```

**User Prompt Template**:
```
Generate a clinical note from this encounter:

Visit Type: {{visit_mode}}
Detail Level: {{detail_level}}
Specialty: {{specialty}}

TRANSCRIPT:
{{transcript}}

Remember to output valid JSON in the exact format specified.
```

**Temperature**: 0.3 (balanced creativity with consistency)  
**Max Tokens**: 4000

**Detail Level Variations**:
- **Low**: "Be concise. Focus only on key findings and essential clinical information."
- **Medium**: "Provide standard clinical documentation with appropriate detail for continuity of care."
- **High**: "Be comprehensive. Include detailed observations, relevant negatives, and thorough documentation."

### 3. ICD-10 Code Suggestion

**Purpose**: Suggest diagnosis codes based on clinical documentation

**System Prompt** (US variant):
```
You are a medical coding expert specializing in ICD-10-CM (US Clinical Modification) diagnosis coding.

CODING PRINCIPLES:
- Suggest codes based on documented diagnoses and clinical findings
- Code to the highest level of specificity supported by the documentation
- Include both primary and secondary diagnoses when applicable
- Provide confidence scores (0.0-1.0) based on documentation clarity
- Do not code suspected or rule-out diagnoses as confirmed
- Follow official coding guidelines for US region

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
- 0.9-1.0: Explicitly stated diagnosis with supporting documentation
- 0.7-0.89: Diagnosis clearly implied by clinical findings
- 0.5-0.69: Possible diagnosis requiring verification
- Below 0.5: Insufficient documentation (do not include)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array of code suggestions:
[
  {
    "code": "ICD-10 code",
    "system": "ICD-10-CM",
    "label": "Full diagnosis description",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "rationale": "Brief explanation of why this code applies"
  }
]

Only include codes with confidence >= 0.5
```

**User Prompt Template**:
```
Suggest ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for this clinical note:

## Context Injection Strategies

### Session Context Building

When building context for AI calls, follow this priority:
1. Patient demographics (name, ID - will be scrubbed before AI submission)
2. Visit type and specialty
3. Existing clinical summary (if available)
4. Previous notes (truncated if needed)
5. Current transcript (may be truncated to fit token limits)

**Token Budget**: ~8000 tokens max for context

### PHI Scrubbing

Before sending to AI, scrub:
- Patient full names → `[PATIENT]`
- Medical record numbers → `[ID]`
- Dates of birth → `[DOB]`
- Dates → `[DATE]`
- Phone numbers → `[PHONE]`
- Email addresses → `[EMAIL]`
- SSN → `[SSN]`

---

## Quality Controls

### Output Validation

All AI outputs are validated for:
1. **Non-empty**: Response contains meaningful content
2. **Format compliance**: JSON where expected, text otherwise
3. **Length appropriateness**: Not suspiciously short or empty
4. **AI refusal patterns**: Detect "I cannot" or "I apologize" patterns
5. **Clinical relevance**: Warnings logged for unusual responses

### Temperature Presets

| Function | Temperature | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Note Generation | 0.3 | Balance creativity with consistency |
| Task Extraction | 0.2 | Highly deterministic, factual |
| Code Suggestion | 0.2 | Accuracy critical, low variance |
| Summarization | 0.3 | Consistent but natural language |
| Ask Heidi | 0.4 | More conversational, helpful tone |

### Max Token Limits

| Function | Max Tokens | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Note Generation | 4000 | Comprehensive SOAP notes |
| Task Extraction | 2000 | List of structured tasks |
| Code Suggestion | 1500 | Code list with rationales |
| Summarization | 500 | Concise summary requirement |
| Ask Heidi | 2000 | Conversational responses |

## Safety & Compliance

### Medical Disclaimers

All AI outputs in the UI should include:
> "AI-generated content. Verify accuracy and completeness before clinical use."

### HIPAA Considerations

- No identifiable PHI sent to AI models
- All PHI scrubbed before AI calls
- Audit logs maintained in `ai_logs` table
- Session tokens used for authentication
- Data encrypted in transit and at rest
